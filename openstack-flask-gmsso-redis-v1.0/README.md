Flask Web Application with Dashboard, Google/Email Auth, and Redis Session Management
This project is a full-stack web application built using the Flask framework. The main objective is to create a robust and secure authentication system that supports both traditional email/password registration and modern social login via Google. The application features a dynamic dashboard accessible only to authenticated users, with a scalable session management system powered by Redis for a seamless user experience.

The long-term plan is to expand this project into a microservices architecture, where the authentication service (this project) can be integrated with other services for a complete Single Sign-On (SSO) solution. The primary goal is to provide a highly scalable, secure, and user-friendly authentication foundation for future projects.

üåü Features
User Authentication:

Google Sign-in: Fast and secure login using Google's OAuth 2.0.

Email/Password Login: Traditional registration and authentication with email verification.

Password Reset: Secure password recovery functionality.

Session Management: Scalable and distributed session handling using Redis and Flask-Session.

Secure Dashboard: A protected area accessible only to logged-in users.

Database: SQLite via Flask-SQLAlchemy for storing user and OAuth data.

Configuration: Sensitive information is managed securely using environment variables from a .env file.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask

Database: SQLite (managed by Flask-SQLAlchemy)

Session Store: Redis

Authentication: Flask-Login, Flask-Dance (Google OAuth)

Email Service: Flask-Mail

üöÄ Setup Guide
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

A running Redis server (e.g., at IP address 192.168.0.207 on port 6379).

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL>
cd openstack-python-flask-gmsso-redis

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:
Install all required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project's root directory and fill in your information based on the example below:

SECRET_KEY="your_flask_secret_key_here"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"
MAIL_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME="your_email@gmail.com"
MAIL_PASSWORD="your_email_app_password"

Note: It's highly recommended to use a Google App Password for MAIL_PASSWORD instead of your regular email password for security.

Set up the database:
Run the following command to create the database tables. This will create a signup-update8.db file.

python app.py --setup

Run the application:
Now you can run the application.

python app.py

The application will be running at http://0.0.0.0:5000. You can access it from your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000 or your machine's IP address (http://192.168.0.93:5000).

üìù Usage
For Developers
Access the Dashboard: Once authenticated, users are redirected to the secure dashboard.

Run a Development Server: The application is configured to run in debug mode, providing automatic reloads on code changes.

Database Management: The SQLite database simplifies development, but it can easily be migrated to a more robust production-ready database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

For Users
Sign Up: Create an account using your email and a strong password. An email confirmation link will be sent for account activation.

Log In: Use your registered credentials or the Google Sign-in button to access your personalized dashboard.

Forgot Password: Utilize the password reset link on the login page to securely reset your password via email.

Dashboard: After successful login, users gain access to their dedicated dashboard area.
